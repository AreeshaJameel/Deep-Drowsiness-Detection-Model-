# Deep-Drowsiness-Detection-Model-
I developed a deep learning-based drowsiness detection model utilizing YOLOv5 from Ultralytics and PyTorch. This model accurately identifies signs of drowsiness in real-time by analyzing facial features and eye movements. Designed for high performance, it enhances safety in applications such as driver monitoring and workplace vigilance.
